Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

Explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.  
1. Here are the data for the project: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
   Download it to your local repository (say "GetCleanData") and rename the folder "UCI HAR Dataset" to "Data"
2. Copy, paste and run script run_analysis.R in your local repository (say "GetCleanData"). Script should create two 
   datasets: tidy_data.txt(that can be used for later analysis) and average_data.txt.
